##This function is from MIL-HDBK-781A and generates the likelihood that a system will pass a reliability test
##M=minimum MTBF
##r = failure free requirement
##Wratio = a real number (between 1 and 2) that, when multiplied by "r" indicates the test window.
  ##The default Wratio is generally accepted to be 2. (W should be up to twice "r". Change it at your own peril!)
